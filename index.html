<h2 class="bottom">Welcome!</h2>
<p>
 Hi!&nbsp; My name is Jeff, and I graduated from the <a href="http://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>
 in May 2010, with a degree in <a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/">Computer Science Engineering</a> along
 with a minor concentration in Music.&nbsp; After having lived in Michigan for most of my life, I have now moved
 to Redmond, Washington and am working full-time with Microsoft as a Software Development Engineer with the
 <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/">Internet Explorer</a> team.&nbsp; Previously, I
 have worked at the <a href="http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/hotline/">CAEN Hotline</a> as a student support
 consultant, where I helped other students (not just engineers!) with their university (and even sometimes
 personal) computer issues, and also performed other small tasks that helped the engineering computing environment
 run smoothly.&nbsp; I was also the Senior Course Assistant for
 <a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~pmchen/">Professor Chen's</a> Microprocessors and Music freshman engineering
 course during the Winter 2010 semester.
</p>
<p>
 I love programming computers, and frequently find myself hacking away at code in either C++, Java or PHP.&nbsp; I
 enjoy writing code to learn a new language (or new aspects of an old language), or to solve small problems I run
 into on a daily basis.&nbsp; Writing code for class or work is fine (and is obviously necessary), but writing code
 for yourself or for something you enjoy is far, far better, and it's what I enjoy most.
</p>
<p>
 When I'm not basking in the glow of a computer screen, I can sometimes be found playing a cello, hanging out with
 friends, or just staring off into space.&nbsp; While the latter sometimes ends up happening more often than not,
 it's still one of my favorite ways to kill time, even if it gets nothing done.
</p>
<p>
 But enough of that.&nbsp; You're here, so why not check out some of <a href="{{ "/fixme/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">the code</a>
 I've written, or read through my <a href="/resume/">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>.&nbsp; Perhaps you'd be interested
 in some of my <a href="{{ "/fixme/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">photography</a> efforts, however bad or underdeveloped (wahh wahh)
 they may be?&nbsp; I'm always trying to put more (meaningful) stuff up here, so check back occasionally to see if
 there's something new that strikes your fancy!
</p>
