name: PHP

PHP, one of my favorite languages, is what got me started with web
programming.  When I was first getting started, I think I had a better grasp
of PHP instead of HTML, which seems odd, in retrospect.  I remember times
where I had to stop designing PHP code so I could teach myself more advanced
HTML so my scripts could display their output in more meaningful ways...
