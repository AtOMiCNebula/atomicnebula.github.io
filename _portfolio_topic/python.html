name: Python

Python is a relatively new language to me.  I've been teaching it to myself as
I put my website together more and more.  It's an interesting language, and
has some features I wasn't expecting: white space provides context within the
language, among other things.  It's been fun, since I haven't tried to learn a
new language in quite a while!
