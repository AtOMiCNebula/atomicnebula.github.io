I've been programming in Java for so long, I can't even remember.  It's easily
one of my favorite languages, and part of the reason I enjoy writing in it is
because it's got a huge library of code already written for me, (hopefully)
built in to every JVM out there.  I've learned a lot about good software
design practices reading through the Java API specification, which really
isn't as bad as some people make it out to be, IMHO.
