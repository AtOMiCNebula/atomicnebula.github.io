title: Slime Volleyball
excerpt: >
  A simple game I implemented for a summer course as assistant instructor at
  Camp CAEN at the University of Michigan.  A 3D remake of an old 2D game, the
  basic idea is to keep the ball on your opponent's side of the court more
  often than the ball is on yours.  Based on the Java applet by Quin Pendragon.
