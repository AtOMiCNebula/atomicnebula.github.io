title: Advanced Console Library
excerpt: >
  Created for a class I taught at Camp CAEN in 2008 (Intermediate C++), this is
  a library that will let you quickly and easily add color to a C++
  application's output.  Other nice features include relocating the cursor to
  different locations on the screen, as well as erasing the screen.  Linux/Unix
  is supported, along with a not-extensively-tested-yet-pretty-reliable MS
  Visual Studio port as well.
