title: Jazz Jackrabbit 2 List Server
excerpt: >
  Back in 2005~2006, I was an active member of the online community for Jazz
  Jackrabbit 2, a popular game for its time.  The game had its own share of
  issues, one of which was that its master multiplayer list server daemon had
  bugs that malicious users had begun to abuse.  I recoded the server in Java,
  solved many of the problems along the way, and even added new features to the
  new server daemon to help administrators keep the game's online experience
  running smoothly.

   Back in 1998, Epic MegaGames (now <a href="http://www.epicgames.com/">Epic Games</a>, creators of the
   Unreal/Gears of War franchises) released a video game named Jazz Jackrabbit 2.&nbsp; A sequel to one of
   the most popular shareware games in 1994, Jazz Jackrabbit, it did a great job at expanding the
   series.&nbsp; One of the notable features of the sequel was bringing it to the Windows environment; the
   original was designed for MS-DOS.&nbsp; Another notable feature was the introduction of multiplayer over
   local area networks, and the internet.
  </p>
  <p>
   While local area networks allow video games to contact other machines in the immediate vicinity by
   broadcasting packets to the local network subnet, this obviously isn't feasible for the internet.&nbsp;
   As such, a "list server" daemon was also created by the game developers to run on a pre-determined
   server that would help coordinate playing games online.&nbsp; The game would contact this server to obtain
   a list of all the currently active games, and it would also contact the list server to notify it that the
   user was hosting a game themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
   There was a problem with the original build of the list server created by the developers, however.&nbsp;
   It had an issue where malicious users could cause a Denial of Service attack by connecting to the server
   as if it was going to inform it that it was going to host a server, but then not send any data.&nbsp; The
   server would stop accepting connections of any kind while it waited for data from the malicious user
   (a normal instance of the game would send this data immediately), but the server was not prepared to
   handle a situation like this, either due to a threading issue (or lack of threading), or some other
   &nbsp; The original developers couldn't be reached by the time this problem was discovered and had begun
   to be abused, so the community had to take matters into their own hands.
  </p>
  <p>
   I was fairly involved with the community around the time this decision was made (centered around a website
   <a href="http://www.jazz2online.com/">Jazz 2 Online</a>), and took it upon myself to redesign the list
   server to fix these issues, using Java.&nbsp; The most pressing issue to fix was that the server needed to
   properly handle situations where these malicious clients would connect and not send any data when the server
   was expecting it.&nbsp; Every time a socket was opened, it was given its own thread of execution, so even if
   an individual thread stalled, it didn't affect the rest of the server, which continued on it's own as if
   nothing was wrong.&nbsp; After the initial framework for the server was set up, it was put into production
   by the heads of the community, and all the problems vanished.&nbsp; It was very gratifying to see my code
   being so well received.
  </p>
  <p class="bottom">
   In replicating the list server, there were (more or less) five different ways of communication I had to
   implement in the server to have it behave as if it was the original server.&nbsp; These were:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Binary list protocol:&nbsp; The server sent a rather minimal amount of information to a requesting
    client, mainly just the IP address and name of the server being hosted.&nbsp; Game clients would access
    this information when displaying the active list of games to the user.</li>
   <li>Game hosting protocol:&nbsp; The server simply listened for incoming information about a game, and
    upon receiving information from the client, would add it to the list to be repeated back to clients.&nbsp;
    It was the issues with this interface that prompted the redesign of the list server.</li>
   <li>Statistics protocol:&nbsp; A simple interface that just repeated statistics and other general
    information about the state of the server back to a connecting client.&nbsp; This was never used in an
    official capacity, and was probably just designed to help with debugging of the server.</li>
   <li>Server mirroring protocol:&nbsp; This was easily the most complicated protocol to reimplement.&nbsp;
    Redundancy is a "good thing" in networks, and the original list server included support for running groups
    of list servers, each one mirroring the other.&nbsp; They communicated with each other over this port; it
    was not indended for clients, and had an access control list so that only pre-defined servers could initiate
    a mirroring session.</li>
   <li>ASCII list protocol:&nbsp; The server simply echoed back a full data dump of all the data it had about
    the servers in a human-readable form to the connecting client.&nbsp; Like the statistics protocol, it was
    never used in an official capacity by any client, but the community has written scripts to take advantage
    of it (web-based games-in-progress scripts mainly).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   After the original functionality had been more or less recreated, we (the group managing the list servers)
   decided to get creative.&nbsp; I had been designing the server to be fairly modular, so that new
   functionality could be added without any real changes needing to be added to the core of the list server.&nbsp;
   The neatest feature we added was a remote administration interface.&nbsp; Upon authenticating, the admin was
   presented with a list of options; servers could be delisted if needed, and malicious users could be added to
   a ban list, among other smaller features.&nbsp; This helped with various other issues with malicious users;
   just like we had figured out how the games communicated with the server and vice versa, so had other people,
   who wrote programs to send false information about hosted games to the list servers.&nbsp; The admin interface
   allowed us to fix these issues without affecting the rest of the hosted games; with the original list server,
   it was necessary to restart the server, which also had the unfortunate effect of delisting any current games.
  </p>
  <p>
   Overall, redesigning the list server was a great experience, and I learned a lot, and had the chance to make
   something that was actually useful to people.&nbsp; Since it's a server daemon, and not exactly a program
   for end-users, it didn't have much of an interface (indeed, the interface it does have isn't fully-functional
   as is), since we realized a graphical interface wasn't really needed, since it was run on a computer, and then
   left alone for extended periods of time.&nbsp; We invested our effort in designing a management layer over a
   telnet session instead of through the GUI (as mentioned earlier).&nbsp; I have included a screenshot of it
   below, but I'm sorry for not posting more...there's just not much to post.
