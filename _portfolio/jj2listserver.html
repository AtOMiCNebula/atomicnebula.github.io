title: Jazz Jackrabbit 2 List Server
excerpt: >
  Back in 2005~2006, I was an active member of the online community for Jazz
  Jackrabbit 2, a popular game for its time.  The game had its own share of
  issues, one of which was that its master multiplayer list server daemon had
  bugs that malicious users had begun to abuse.  I recoded the server in Java,
  solved many of the problems along the way, and even added new features to the
  new server daemon to help administrators keep the game's online experience
  running smoothly.
