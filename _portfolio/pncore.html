title: Planet Nebula (This Website)
excerpt: >
  I've had a website at this address (Planet-Nebula.com) since 2001, but like
  most websites, it's gone through plenty of revisions along the way.  From
  initial my initial experiments with HTML, PHP, MySQL and such, up to today
  with its snazzy Django back-end, it's been quite a trip.
