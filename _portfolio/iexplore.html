title: Internet Explorer
excerpt: >
  During the summer of 2009, I had an internship with Microsoft in Seattle, WA
  as a developer with the Internet Explorer product team.  My main summer
  project was to work with the Object Model team to add support for CSS3
  Selectors in preparation for Internet Explorer 9.  Since CSS3 Selectors
  support has been officially announced as of PDC '09, I'm allowed to discuss
  it...somewhat, anyways.
